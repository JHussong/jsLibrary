//Assign a value to a variable then use the variable to stand for the thing:

const feetInMile = 5260;
console.log(feetInMile);

//Variables can be named whatever you choose but it is best to use a name that other devs will understand:

var ageOfMyOldestFerret = 40;
var numberOfEggsInOneSitting = 50;

//Variable names, in most cases, should be camel cased. This means that the first word is lower case and each consecutive word is upper case:

var numberOfGrammysIHaveWon = 0; 
var myBirthYear = 1976;
var newNumber = 1 * numberOfGrammysIHaveWon;

//Think it through:

var age = 40;
var ageInAugust = age + 1;  
console.log(ageInAugust);//What will you get here? 41

var eleven = 11;
console.log(eleven * eleven); //What will the answer be? 121

var nineteen = 19;
console.log(age - nineteen); //What will the answer be? 21
